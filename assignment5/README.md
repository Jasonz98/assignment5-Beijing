As our team's topic is basketball. I divide into six sections to demonstrate our topic.

## Starting at the home page
I think "Basketball" will be our brand name, it will be at the top left of the page and we can add an icon next to it.
To the top right, there should be the sign-in link and if visitors don't have an account they can click on the sign-up link.(I have created the sign-in and sign-up pages but they are only the 
structure and have no content yet.)
Then further down, I plan the section as the introduction of our website and the navigations should appear as bubbles. This section should stay in the center of the page.I have written some 
rough css to show what I image the bubble should generally look like(It's really a bad demonstration as I envision some real bubbles but not the border.)(If you guys think it's really hard to carry
out, we can think of another layout)

## For the rest of the page
The brand and sign-in/sign-up section should stay the same as the homepage.
The navigation bar should be just right down the header.
Also, consider using the brand as a link to go back to homepage.
For the rest of the page, I consider using the simple top-to-bottom style.(Not sure if the description is accurate)

### History and development
This page talks about the creation of basketball and its development.
As there are a lot of headings in this page, I would suggest divide it into two sections each wrapped with borders.
I wrote some css to rougly show what the development part should look like

### Rules/NBA
Both the page should follow the overall style.
These two pages should simply display the information from top to bottom with clear margins to distinguish each sections

### Players
The page features four amazing players, each with a description and a photo of them.
The photo should either be displayed all to the right/left and should be displayed one to the left and one to the right. This can be flexible as long as it looks good.

### Take a survey
I choose four questions and give a selection for the last question.
As the survey need to be displayed in tables, I choose questions that don't require a lot of words to answer.
The survey should be in the center of the page, as leave the same margin top and bottom.

## Overall styles
1.As we are talking about basketball. I believe the overall style should be vigourous and energetic.I suggest using warm colors.
2.I have found some background images they are named as bg1/bg2/bg3 in the images folder. We can choose from them or we can use plain colors as background.(Only a suggestion)
3.The font choice should look comfortable. We should have three fonts for headings/ paragraphs and homepage "explore our website" and the words in the bubbles.
4.For interactivity, most of them are stated in the above section. I would suggest that after the survey is sumbitted, users should be taken to the sign-in page. 

## Other things
1.I have already installed bootstraps.
2.All the pages are still html pages.
3.The size of the photo on "players" page might need to be adjusted
4.A is-current indictator needs to be installed.
5.If you see any problem with the content, please tell me (I'm really not so familiar with basketball)
